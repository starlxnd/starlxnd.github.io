                            <p>hi i am ventura. i am a web developer with experience in js / html / css, with some backend knowledge of python (flask / django) and mysql. i have been programming for 8 years, starting when i was 10 years old.</p>

                            <p>i have a passion for computer science and for design, i believe that every website should be beautiful to look at and convenient to use for the user. i have been interested in web development since 16 and am always eager to advance my skills, learning everything as i go - web development is a fluid, evolving space, and there is always something new to learn and something old to master.</p>

                    <p><i>exploring the countryside</i> was a week-long online puzzle event. it was written run, and hosted by a team of people (including me) that hosted over 350 teams. my involvement in this project was as a member of the writing and web-development team. i worked on post-production, designing the site itself, and setting some of the puzzles.</p>

                    <p>we used a django-based framework and pythonanywhere to host the website, which was suitable to support a userbase of at least 500 people across the full week. we also patched up any problems that arose during the event itself. we implemented a notification system as our email dispatcher stopped working, and we answered to any hint requests quickly, with most being responded to in 2 minutes or less.</p>

                    <p><i>exploring the countryside</i> was my first foray into running a digital event. we worked closely as a team to deliver a fun yet challenging experience to all teams, with a focus on making the UX of the website itself smooth.</p>

                    <p><i>a girl is a gun</i> is the title of a collaboration between myself and a friend. my friend wrote all the work and discussed what they wanted it to look like, and i was tasked to implement it into a website. some of the effects were complex and required a lot of work to pull off, such as the diagonal scrolling marquees and the 'foldable' page.</p>

                    <p>all the effects were achieved in html, css, and js. an external library (anime.js) was used for certain effects. working on this project taught me a lot of things, and it made me a lot more proficient at html and css.</p>

                    <p><i>a girl is a gun</i> took a few months of work to create, with ideas being abandoned due to complexity, while certain ideas were birthed completely accidentally. i learned here that web design is occasionally fluid, with certain ideas being formed as you go along.</p>

                    <p><i>save the trees</i> was a project wherein i and a group of 3 others developed a website for a company. the website had three requirements: to handle transactions for both admins and users, to ensure that all information was secure and could not be compromised, and to use an external database for data handling.</p>

                    <p>the website allowed users to log in, purchase products and keep track of their purchased products. admins could view transactions and users and take action wherever necessary. there was mysql integration and an email handler to automate the sending of emails.</p>

                    <p><i>save the trees</i> took 16 weeks to create. it taught me a lot about backend development, just as much as frontend, and gave me a new appreciation for a facet of development i tend to neglect. learning how to handle and use the flask framework, as well as a mysql database, was a valuable lesson in being flexible, adapting to the needs of the project wherever possible.</p>
